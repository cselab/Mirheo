/** \brief A triangle mesh with face connectivity, adjacent vertices and geometric precomputed values.
    This class was designed to assist MembraneInteraction.

    A stress-free state can be associated to the mesh.
    The precomputed geometric quantities that are stored in the object are computed from the stress free state.

    Additionally to the list of faces (\see Mesh), this class contains a list of
    adjacent vertices for each vertex.
    The list is stored in a single array, each vertex having a contiguous chunk of length maxDegree.
    See developer docs for more information.
