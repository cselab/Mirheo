/** \brief Helper class to control when the stress must be computed.

    In theory stresses could be computed at every time step, but with a higher cost
    (higher bandwidth needed and more computation).
    In practice stress does not need to be computed at every iteration.
    Instead we compute stresses every given periods of simulation time.
