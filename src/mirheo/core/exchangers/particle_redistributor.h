    The redistribution consists in moving (not copying) the particles from one rank to the other.
    It affects all particles that have left the current subdomain.
    The redistribution is accelerated by making use of the cell-lists of the ParticleVector.
    This allows to check only the particles that are on the boundary cells;
    However, this assumes that only those particles leave the domain.
