/** \brief Advance one ObjectVector associated with internal forces with smaller time step.

    We distinguish slow forces, which are computed outside of this class, from fast forces,
    computed only inside this class.
    Each time step given by the simulation is split into n sub time steps.
    Each of these sub time step advances the object using the non updated slow forces and the updated
    fast forces n times.

    This was motivated by the separation of time scale of membrane viscosity (fast forces) and solvent
    viscosity (slow forces) in blood.

    \rst
    .. warning::
        The fast forces should NOT be registered in the \c Simulation.
        Otherwise, it will be executed twice (by the simulation and by this class).
