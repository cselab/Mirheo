class Bouncer:
    r"""
        Base class for bouncing particles off the objects.
        Take bounce kernel as argument:

        * **kernel** = "bounce_back":
            Bounces back the particle.
            The new velocity of the particle is given by:

            .. math::

                \mathbf{u}_\text{new} = \mathbf{u}_\text{wall} - \left( \mathbf{u}_\text{old} - \mathbf{u}_\text{wall} \right).

        * **kernel** = "bounce_maxwell":
            Reinsert particle at the collision point with a velocity drawn from a maxwellian distribution.
            Need the additional parameter **kBT (real)**.
            The new velocity of the particle is given by:

            .. math::

                \mathbf{u}_\text{new} = \mathbf{u}_\text{wall} + \sqrt{\frac {k_BT} {m}} \xi,

            where :math:`\xi \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, 1\right)`.

class Mesh(Bouncer):
    r"""
        This bouncer will use the triangular mesh associated with objects to detect boundary crossings.
        Therefore it can only be created for Membrane and Rigid Object types of object vectors.
        Due to numerical precision, about :math:`1` of :math:`10^5 - 10^6` mesh crossings will not be detected, therefore it is advised to use that bouncer in
        conjunction with correction option provided by the Object Belonging Checker, see :ref:`user-belongers`.

        .. note::
            In order to prevent numerical instabilities in case of light membrane particles,
            the new velocity of the bounced particles will be a random vector drawn from the Maxwell distibution of given temperature
            and added to the velocity of the mesh triangle at the collision point.
