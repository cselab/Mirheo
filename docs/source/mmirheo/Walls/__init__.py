        This wall is based on an arbitrary Signed Distance Function (SDF) defined in the simulation domain on a regular Cartesian grid.

        First two lines define the header: three real number separated by spaces govern the size of the domain where the SDF is defined,
        and next three integer numbers (:math:`Nx\,\,Ny\,\,Nz`) define the resolution.
        Next the :math:`Nx \times Ny \times Nz` single precision realing point values are written (in binary representation).

        Negative SDF values correspond to the domain, and positive -- to the inside of the wall.
        The boundary is defined by the zero-level isosurface.
