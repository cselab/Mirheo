Mirheo
########

Mesoscale flow solver for biological and medical applications.

Mirheo [alexeev2020]_ is designed as a classical molecular dynamics code adapted for inclusion of large (consisting of thousands of particles) rigid bodies and cells.
The main features of the code include:

* fluids represented as free particles interacting with different pairwise potentials (i.e. DPD or Lennard-Jones),
* static walls of arbitrary complexity and size,
* rigid bodies with arbitrary shapes and sizes [amoudruz2021]_,
* viscoelastic cell membranes [economides2021]_, that can separate inner from outer fluids

The multi-process GPU implementation enables very fast time-to-solution without compromising physical complexity
and Python front-end ensures fast and easy simulation setup.
Some benchmarks are listed in :ref:`user-bench`.

The following documentation is aimed at providing users a comprehensive simulation guide
as well as exposing code internals for the developers wishing to contribute to the project.
